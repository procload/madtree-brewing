  - name: "Brady"
    title: "Secretary of Beer Defense"
    bio: "Brady grew up in Massillon Ohio and graduated from the University of Dayton with a degree in public relations and marketing. At UD he mostly drank cheap beer and is now atoning for his mistakes by consuming copious amounts of good beer. Passionate to discover the beautiful South (or follow his wife's career), he worked in sales for two years before going back to school for his MBA at the University of Alabama. He was recruited to P&G where he worked for 4 years in the analytics space. While in Bama he developed a passion for good beer through his buddy (and investor) Shane. After attending GABF in 2008 the passion turned into obsession and he began homebrewing shortly after. He met Jeff and Kenny in 2009 and the rest is that of folklore. He is married to Amie with a son, Crosby, and dog, Gus."

  - name: "Matt"
    title: "Brewery Utility Man"
    bio: "Matt is a native of Cincinnati, Ohio and graduated from Penn State University with a degree in Economics and Business Law.  Upon his return to Cincinnati after school to work, a good high-school friend showed Matt some old wine and beer making equipment he had found in his dad's basement and as they often say, the rest is history.  Homebrewing began as a hobby but quickly spiraled into a full time obsession, including Matt building a fully functional brewery in the basement of his home and brewing two, three, and even four times a month.  That obsession took the next step when he began looking for opportunities to volunteer at local breweries around town, and when Matt enrolled in The Siebel Institute of Technology for some formal brewing education.  What once was a frequent day-dream became a true reality when Matt got the opportunity to trade in his dress shoes for a pair of brewer's boots and join MadTree as an Assistant Brewer & Cellarman, and he's never looked back."
