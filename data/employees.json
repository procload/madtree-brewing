    "bio" : "Brady grew up in Massillon Ohio and graduated from the University of Dayton with a degree in public relations and marketing. At UD he mostly drank cheap beer and is now atoning for his mistakes by consuming copious amounts of good beer. Passionate to discover the beautiful South (or follow his wife's career), he worked in sales for two years before going back to school for his MBA at the University of Alabama. He was recruited to P&G where he worked for 4 years in the analytics space. While in Bama he developed a passion for good beer through his buddy (and investor) Shane. After attending GABF in 2008 the passion turned into obsession and he began homebrewing shortly after. He met Jeff and Kenny in 2009 and the rest is that of folklore. He is married to Amie with a son, Crosby, and dog, Gus.",
