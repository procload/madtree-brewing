          <h3>Richard Biever</h3>
          <h4>Gnarly Brown illustrator</h4>
          <p>Art is my passion &ndash; Creating beautiful images and showcasing the extraordinary in a picture. For the past 12 years, I&rsquo;ve run my own business working with ad agencies and art directors across the U.S. Before that, I worked for an ad agency for 20 years.

          <h3>Tony Gilardi</h3>
          <h4>Identity Crisis illustrator</h4>
          <p>In 1996, at the College of Mount St. Joseph, I completed a BFA in Graphic Design.  Also at Mount St. Joseph, in 2001, I completed an MA in Art Education.  Since 1997 I have taught Art, both at the middle-grades level and currently at the senior high level, in the Northwest Local School district.  I&rsquo;ve stayed active creating and exhibiting artwork in galleries and venues throughout the Cincinnati area, and have had a chance to design a logo or two along the way.  My work ranges from high-value graphite drawings to mixed-media abstracts.  Nature, and in particular trees, seem to be my principal inspirations.  Currently I live in West Harrison, IN, with my wife.  I&rsquo;ve been a homebrewer for 15 years, and have grown my own hops for the last 8 years.  I heartily recommend homebrewing and hop-growing to all.</p>

          <h3>John Doubet</h3>
          <h4>Thundersnow illustrator</h4>
          <p>Since the mid-90’s, John Doubet has partnered with some of the most respected brands around the globe. </p>
          <p>Through these successful synergies Doubet has garnered numerous advertising and design awards. In addition, his work has been published in leading industry trades such as Graphis (widely regarded as an international bastion of design and visual imagery) and Print (which annually features the most comprehensive survey of graphic design in the US) magazines. Further, Doubet is the proud recipient of a national American Advertising Award (ADDY).</p>
          <p>Doubet has designed successful campaigns in multiple disciplines ranging from the retail industry to consumer packaging to business-to-business. </p>

          <p>When not expanding a company’s position in the marketplace, you can find him recording music, golfing, fishing, hiking, and spending time with his family. And not necessarily in that order. </p>
