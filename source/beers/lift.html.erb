      <p>Timber - It's what you yell when a tree comes falling down.  Maybe it's also the sound of pre-conceived notions falling of what a craft beer should taste like.  Or what you yell when you ditch your assumptions that a beer snob only drinks dark or high ABV beers. Either way the Timber will give you plenty of flavor in a light and refreshing drink.  If a tree falls in the woods, and there's no one around to hear it, we're pretty sure you'll still enjoy this beer.</p>
